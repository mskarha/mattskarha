<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Walking down the street with my headphones on, I observe that I am
listening to both continuous-time signals (my footsteps, the cars
passing by) and digitally-processed discrete-time signals (lofi house
mix on SoundCloud through my headphones). However, my brain more-or-less
perceives them as both continuous-time, in a way blurring the lines
between the analog and digital worlds. At the center of this blurring
is, of course, signal processing. Wielding this idea has numerous
applications, particularly for digital sound synthesis for music
creation. If we can understand how to model mechanical and acoustical
systems that are governed by physical laws using discrete-time and
discrete-space mathematical formalisms, we can simulate these systems
with a control that might not be feasible in the analog realm. This is
then the task of physical modeling sound synthesis.</p>

<h1 id="physical-modeling-for-sound-synthesis">Physical Modeling for Sound Synthesis</h1>

<p>Within the realm of computer music, a number of formalisms for physical
modeling have been proposed over the past forty years. A few are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finite difference schemes</li>
  <li>lumped models</li>
  <li>digital waveguides</li>
  <li>modal synthesis</li>
  <li>finite element modeling</li>
  <li>state-space techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>Certainly each of these formalisms have their own pros and cons and will
be suitable or unsuitable depending on the system. Often combinations of
techniques can be used to achieve a more precise model. In 2003,
Castagne and Cadoz proposed 10 general criteria for evaluating physical
modeling techniques oriented to music creation [1]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How efficient is the algorithm?</li>
  <li>How faithful are the synthesized sounds?</li>
  <li>How diverse are the categories of instruments that can be modelled?</li>
  <li>Is the scheme exclusively dedicated to sound synthesis or more
general?</li>
  <li>How robust is sound plausability?</li>
  <li>How modular is the technique?</li>
  <li>How intuitive and effective is the associated mental model?</li>
  <li>How deep is the modeling process enabled by the scheme?</li>
  <li>Do generation algorithms exist?</li>
  <li>Is there a friendly musician-oriented environment for using the
scheme?</li>
</ol>

<p>While it is not the task of this project to compare and contrast
modeling schemes, I think these are good criteria to keep in mind when
considering this project.</p>

<h1 id="mass-interaction-physical-modeling">Mass-Interaction Physical Modeling</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Mass-Interaction Physical Modeling is one of the oldest techniques for
digital sound synthesis via physical modeling. It was pioneered
beginning in 1978 by the CORDIS-ANIMA system developed at ACROE in
Grenoble, France [2]. The basic idea is to represent physical systems
in the form of lumped networks composed of two main components: mass
objects and interaction objects. Mass objects represent material points
in a given space with some inertial behavior while interaction objects
represent a specific type of coupling between mass objects (i.e.
visco-elastic, collision, non-linear). By doing this, we avoid the need
to explicitly define a mathematical model such as a partial differential
equation system with boundary conditions (as is needed in finite
difference methods).</p>

<p>Within the past few years, there has been somewhat of a renewed interest
in mass-interaction physical modeling, driven by the release of a
Max/MSP package mi-gen~ [3]
(<a href="#https://github.com/mi-creative/mi-gen">github</a>) and a Faust [4]
(<a href="#https://github.com/rmichon/mi_faust">github</a>) library. These tools
have certainly improved the accessibility of MI-modeling thanks to the
inclusion of a model scriptor that translates a high level model into
lower level code.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>In order to model the physics of masses and interactions in
discrete-time, we will apply a second order central difference scheme to
Newton’s second law. For a point mass, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f = ma = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">f</script> is the force applied to the mass, <script type="math/tex">m</script> is its inertia, <script type="math/tex">a</script> is
its acceleration, and <script type="math/tex">x</script> is its position.</p>

<p>Using a second order central difference scheme with sampling period
<script type="math/tex">\Delta T</script>, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(t) = m\frac{x(t+\Delta T) - 2x(t) + x(t-\Delta T)}{\Delta T^2}.</script>

<p>To discretize, we simply convert the sample period into a sample and
collect the continuous-time parameters into a discrete-time inertial
constant <script type="math/tex">M = \frac{m}{\Delta T^2}.</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f[n] = M(x[n+1] - 2x[n] + x[n-1]).</script>

<p>Rearranging terms, we can achieve a difference equation that describes
the discrete-time position of a mass as a result of the external forces
being applied:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x[n+1] = 2x[n] - x[n-1] + \frac{f[n]}{M}.</script>

<p>A very common object in mass-interaction modeling is a visco-elastic
spring connecting two masses. Consider a spring with stiffness parameter
<script type="math/tex">k</script> and damping parameter <script type="math/tex">z</script>. Hooke’s Law tells us that the force
needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance <script type="math/tex">x</script> scales
linearly with respect to that distance. In the case of a spring
connecting masses as shown in Figure 1, we have</p>

<p align="center">
  <img height="100" src="\assets\img\spring.png" /><br />
  <em>Figure 1. A visco-elastic spring connecting two masses, m_1 and m_2 at
positions x_1 and x_2, respectively.</em>
</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{s,1\rightarrow 2} = -k(x_2 - x_1)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">x_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">x_2</script> are the positions of the two masses <script type="math/tex">m_1</script> and
<script type="math/tex">m_2</script>, respectively. In discrete-time, this is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{s,1\rightarrow 2}[n] = -K(x_2[n] - x_1[n])</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">K = k</script> is the discrete-time stiffness parameter.</p>

<p>If we approximate damping to the first-order, we have the following
relationship describing the force from <script type="math/tex">m_1</script> onto <script type="math/tex">m_2</script> as a result of
the damper:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{d,1\rightarrow 2} = -z\frac{d(x_2 - x_1)}{dt}.</script>

<p>Using a first-order backward difference scheme to discretize the
derivative, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{d,1\rightarrow 2} = -z\frac{(x_2(t) - x_1(t)) - (x_2(t-\Delta T) - x_1(t-\Delta T))}{\Delta T},</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\Delta T</script> is the sampling period. In discrete-time, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{d,1\rightarrow 2}[n] = -Z[(x_2[n] - x_2[n-1]) - (x_1[n] - x_1[n-1])].</script>

<p>Thus, we have computed the discrete-time external forces for a spring
connecting two masses. More common, however, is the world-reknown linear
harmonic damped oscillator (mass on a spring) where one end of the
spring is now fixed to a point, as shown in Figure 2. Writing the sum of
the forces on mass <script type="math/tex">m</script> as a result of the spring and the damper, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{tot, m}[n] = f_{s,m}[n] + f_{d,m}[n]</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{tot, m}[n] = -Kx[n] - Zx[n] + Zx[n-1].</script>

<p>We can now substitute this expression into the discrete-time Newton’s
second law from above and rearrange terms to achieve a difference
equation that describes the motion of a harmonic oscillator.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img height="100" src="\assets\img\springmass.png" /><br />
  <em>Figure 2. A visco-elastic spring connecting a mass and a fixed point.</em>
</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x[n+1] = \left( 2 - \frac{K+Z}{M}\right)x[n] + \left(\frac{Z}{M} -1 \right ) x[n-1]</script>

<p>Notice that the position of the mass at time <script type="math/tex">n+1</script> simply depends on a
linear combination of the position of the mass at time <script type="math/tex">n</script> and <script type="math/tex">n-1</script>,
where the coefficients are simply terms in the stiffness parameter <script type="math/tex">K</script>,
the damping parameter <script type="math/tex">Z,</script> and the inertial parameter <script type="math/tex">M</script>. In practice,
these parameters are normalized to 1. Although they are functions of the
sample rate, they do provide a direct view of stability conditions for
the system. In order to stay in an oscillatory regime, we must have
<script type="math/tex">4M > K + 2Z</script>. A derivation of stability conditions for the linear
harmonic oscillator can be found in the appendix of [3].</p>

<h2 id="building-topologies">Building Topologies</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="\assets\img\triangle.png" /><br />
  <em>Figure 3. Physical model of a triangle. Taken from
[4].</em>
</p>

<p>Based on this formalism, modeling with MI involves building a
geometrical model by positioning and connecting masses together through
interaction objects, and by specifying the parameters and initial
conditions for each one. Figure 3 shows a basic physical model of a
triangle (the percussion instrument). Three masses are joined by
dampened springs with one of the masses fixed to a point. The system is
then excited by a pluck at the input module and the output is taken from
one of the masses. Because sound is essentially just air being pushed,
we can listen to the motion of a given mass as the output of our system.</p>

<p>One main advantage arises when comparing MI modeling with other physical
modeling paradigms: It introduces the ability to build and excite
virtual mechanical constructions that are not bounded by realism. We
know from more traditional musical acoustics research that many
nonlinear behaviors exist in acoustic musical instruments which
contribute to their unique and interesting timbres. It is often the task
of other physical modeling techniques to model these nonlinearities for
a given system with the goal of achieving a more realistic sound
synthesis. With MI modeling, we are "atomically" building structures
grounded in Newton’s second law, meaning nonlinear behavior will arise
naturally if a system is excited properly and maintains numerical
stability. If we can model and excite the right structure, theoretically
we can discover new interesting behaviors and sounds for use in an
artistic process.</p>

<p>One main disadvantage, however, is the task at hand. It is difficult to
develop an intuition of how to model structures to achieve a certain
timbre or behavior, especially when there are three parameters to adjust
for every object. The goal of this project, then, is to simplify this
process by introducing higher level (timbral) control objects to build
MI geometries.</p>

<h1 id="towards-higher-level-control-of-mi-systems">Towards Higher Level Control of MI Systems</h1>

<p>This project attempts to introduce higher level control objects for
mass-interaction physical models. This was done by first assessing what
a set optimal control parameters would look like in this context. Next,
a series of experiments were conducted to build models for the
relationships between existing parameters and optimal parameters. And
finally, a Max patch was developed with these controls as input to
determine if it is a more intuitive approach to MI modeling.</p>

<h2 id="optimal-control-parameters">Optimal Control Parameters</h2>

<p>If an artist wants to use mass-interaction modeling as a sound synthesis
paradigm in their creative process, what parameters would they be
interested in controlling? Considering the victories of previous
synthesizers, I contend pitch and decay rate would be suitable as a
start.</p>

<p>As for timbral control, we can use spectral descriptors to build a
control object. Spectral descriptors are a set of perceptually-relevant
algorithms that can be computed on any audio signal to learn information
about that signal. Some examples are spectral centroid, decrease,
kurtosis, and spread. Sound events are analyzed in terms of various
input representations including the short-term Fourier transform,
harmonic sinusoidal components, and an auditory model based on the
equivalent rectangular bandwidth concept. A number of audio descriptors
are then derived from each of these representations to capture temporal,
spectral, spectrotemporal, and energetic properties of the sound events
[5].</p>

<p>There are often correlations between spectral descriptors and perceptual
attributes. For example, spectral centroid is known to be correlated
with brightness. I contend that we can exploit this idea to obtain
higher level control over mass-interaction physical models.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="\assets\img\fundfit.png" /><br />
  <em>Figure 4.Inertial parameter M vs. fundamental frequency. A least-squares fit
indicates a first-order power law
relationship.</em>
</p>

<p>To determine the relationship between the inertial parameter and the
pitch, an experiment was carried out by varying the inertial parameter
<script type="math/tex">M</script> and estimating the fundamental frequency, as shown in Figure 4. A 50
mass string was used as the test structure. The data was fit to a
first-order power law of the form <script type="math/tex">f(x) = ax^b</script> and a 0.9995 R-square
value was achieved. Thus, to control the inertial parameter with pitch,
an inverse function <script type="math/tex">f^{-1}(x)</script> is taken and solved for <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">M = af_0^b</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_0 = \sqrt[b]{M/a},</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">M</script> is the discrete-time inertial parameter, <script type="math/tex">f_0</script> is the
fundamental frequency in Hz, <script type="math/tex">a = 113.4</script>, and <script type="math/tex">b = -0.4982</script>. It is
important to note that while the first order power law relationship
holds across different structures, the coefficients of the model do not
and can therefore not be generalizable. This drastically increases the
difficulty for pitch control via inertial parameter modulation and it
would likely be easier to use known pitch shifting techniques.</p>

<p>Next, an experiment was carried out to determine the relationship
between the inertial parameter and the decay time, as shown in Figure 5.
This indicated a linear relationship between the two variables and a
control object was constructed accordingly. Again, while the fit
coefficients are not generalizable for any given structure, the linear
relationship holds.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img height="250" src="\assets\img\decayfit.png" /><br />
  <em>Figure 5. Inertial parameter M vs. decay time (ms). A least-squares fit
indicates a linear relationship.</em>
</p>

<p>To determine what a timbral control object would look like, a number of
experiments were carried out using spectral descriptors to try to
determine the relationship between MI geometry and timbre. First,
several spectral descriptors were measured against the number of masses
in an ideal string to determine the timbral effect of masses. Some of
the results are shown in Figure 6. Adding masses to a string therefore
decreases centroid, increases spectral decrease, increases kurtosis, and
decreases slope.</p>

<p>Then, six mid-level macro objects were constructed using the Mass
Interaction Model Scripter (MIMS) provided in the mi-gen  Max/MSP
toolbox: string (ideal string fixed at both ends), stiff string (a
string accounting for 2nd order stiffness, fixed at both ends), a chain
(string but not fixed at end), mesh (2d string with open boundary
conditions), closedMesh (entirely fixed boundary conditions), and
cornerMesh (fixed points at each of the four corners). Then, the
parameters were tuned so that all objects had the same fundamental
frequency and damping (it doesn’t make sense to compare timbres of
objects of different pitches/decays). The objects were measured against
spectral descriptors (centroid, decrease, kurtosis, spread, skewness,
rolloff) to try to determine their effect on the timbre. Some of the
results are shown in Figure 7. The main takeaway from these experiments
was that not fixing points has the effect of boosting low frequencies
(as in the case of the chain).</p>

  <em>Figure 7. Some results of experiment testing timbral effects of various
mid-level structures.</em>
</p>

<h2 id="max-patch">Max Patch</h2>

<p>A Max patch was constructed with a novel "timbral control" object
based on the results of the experiments in the previous section. The
object is based off of Max’s <em>pattrstorage</em> object while allows for
linear interpolation between presets. Six timbral "modes" are
contained as presets in this object, between which the user can
interpolate. The modes were determined by varying the gain of each of
the six macro objects described earlier while holding the other five
constant and determining their effect on six spectral descriptors
(centroid, kurtosis, decrease, skewness, rolloff). If a spectral
descriptor quantity reached a maximum as the gains were varied, it was
determined to be a timbral "mode" and was added to the object.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>Mass-Interaction Physical Modeling is a physical modeling sound
synthesis technique performed by representing physical systems in the
form of lumped networks composed of two main components: mass objects
and interaction objects. Modeling with MI involves building a
geometrical model by positioning and connecting masses together through
interaction objects, and by specifying the parameters and initial
conditions for each one. However, it is difficult to achieve intuition
over how to build physical models since the objects are so low-level.
This project sought to create higher level timbral control objects by
experimenting with spectral descriptors across various topologies.</p>

<p>While I have made some progress towards higher level control of MI
models, there is still far more to be done. The task ended up being far
more difficult than I expected and would require a much deeper
understanding in order to implement such an object in a synthesizer.
Nonetheless, I believe MI modeling has endless potential as a physical
modeling technique and I look forward to continue studying it in the
future.</p>
