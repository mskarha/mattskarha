I am currently a master's student at McGill University in Montr√©al, QC studying Music Technology. My research interests include audio signal processing, computational acoustics, human and machine audition, and source separation. In particular, I am interested in microphone and speaker array processing for real-time sound spatialization and signal enhancement in augmented listening applications, especially for live electroacoustic performance. My thesis is co-supervised by Professor Gary Scavone and Professor Philippe Depalle and supported by [CIRMMT](https://www.cirmmt.org/). In 2019, I graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Physics and minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. A copy of my [CV](/cv) is available. 

The purpose of this website is largely for me to teach myself about web design via HTML and CSS. If you're also looking to begin web design, I highly recommend starting with Jekyll and Github Pages. These are two incredibly powerful tools for generating professional-looking static sites. 

This website is still very much under construction. I will be adding some of my projects and blog posts eventually, so check back soon if you are interested in that.
